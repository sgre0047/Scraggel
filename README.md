# Creature description:
Scraggel is a twisted, forest-dwelling creature born from the aftermath of failed animal
experimentation in a hidden lab.It was once a harmless whipped cream bunny like animal
found during a exploration in a magical forest, however Scraggel was mutated into a
nightmare being after years of exposure to chemical testing and bioengineering done on it.
After the lab which was secluded blasted due to some failed experiments, Scraggle escaped
and made that forest its home.
It roams the deep, dark forests, where thick mists and dead trees dominate the landscape.
As a monster role in the game, Scraggel is a stealthy threat lurking silently among shadows,
It warns the players to leave his area before ambusing them unsuspectedly. Its thin frame
allows it to slip easily between trees and hide behind natural cover, while its worn, patchy
skin provides camouflage against the rotting area. Scraggel has adapted to environmental
hazards such as toxic air and unstable ground, developing enhanced night vision and a
near-silent walk. It moves awkwardly but unpredictably and fast, often dragging its
malformed leg, adding to its eerie presence. Scraggel thrives at night, blending seamlessly
with the darkness.
# Reasoning Behind the Concept:
The design of Scraggel is inspired by themes of natureâ€™s revenge against human tampering.
Its creepy body hints at past trauma and adaptation to a poisoned world. Its unsettling
appearance and unpredictable movements enhance fear, fitting perfectly into a
horror-themed survival or exploration game where every shadow could be hiding a threat.
